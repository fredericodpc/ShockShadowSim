# Simulation of Observable In-Flight Shockwave Shadows

Sunlight impinging on an aircraft interacts with the shock waves that form due to the high-speed
flow and produce an optical phenomenon comprising of a shadow and caustic pattern extending
along the wing span. This direct natural shadowgraph feature is visible under particular
observer, vehicle operation and illumination conditions.
